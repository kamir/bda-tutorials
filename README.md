# bda-tutorials

BDA-Tutorial is a collection of data sets and references to open data sets which are to large for duplicatiing them. Each modul contians data, and tools for one particular task or group of takss. The focus is in functional blocks which solve a problem or help to understand the approach. Instead of sofware modules or data sets, the focus is on the tutorial aspects, targeting the learning experience. The project focus is in the following questions: 

+ How to teach data engineering and data science procedures which are not yet production ready?
+ How to demonstrate and compare concepts?
+ How to evaluate solutions regarding quality and cost?
